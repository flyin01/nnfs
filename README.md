#### terminology ####  
Layers of neurons.  
Layer size: 10,8,8,8,2. With 8x3 hidden layers.  
Weights: 224, unique connections/lines between neurons.  
Biases: 36, unique neurons.  
Params: 260, unique tunable parameters.  

This gives us complex relations that can in theory be mapped. The question is how to tune such a thing.
