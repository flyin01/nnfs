    "For our model we want it to be a classifier, so we need a activaion function meant for classification. One of these is the Softmax activation function. Why another activation function? In this case the rectified linear unit is unbounded, not normalized with other units and exclusive. Not norlmalized means a number or value can be anything, an output of [23, 87, 220] is without context and exclusive means each output is independet of each other.  \n",

    "To adress this lack of context, the softmax activation on output data can take non-normalized (uncalibrated) inputs and produce a normalized distribution of probabilities for our classes. Thedistribution returned by the softwax activation function represents a confidence score for each class and will add upp to 1."

A negative probability (or confidence) does not make sense to us. An exponential value of any number is always non-negative - it returns 0 for negative infinity, 1 for the input of 0, and increases for positive values."
